some Projects  

 Share prediction:
 I used previous data for share prediction of BARUN hydropower, used linear regression and was my first project.

eHike: Trekking Gear Rental Platform  
An e-commerce website built with Django for renting trekking gear.  

 Predictive Analytics for Customer Churn  
A machine learning model to predict customer churn for businesses.What I performed was rental prediction taking data from kaggle.  

 Image Classification with CNNs (Ongoing)  
A deep learning model for classifying images using CNNs. Cat or dog 

More projects can be found in my Github.All projects which I performed using each algorithm of ML  do already exist but I did it following course guidiance.
